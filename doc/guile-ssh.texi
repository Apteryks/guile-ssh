@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Guile-SSH is a library that provides access to the @acronym{SSH}
protocol for programs written in
@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/, GNU Guile}.  It is a wrapper
to the underlying @url{http://www.libssh.org/, libssh} library.  This
manual is partly based on libssh documentation.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Guile-SSH sources are available from GitHub at
@url{https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/}.  This section
describes requirements of Guile-SSH and installation process.

Guile-SSH depends on the following packages:

@itemize
@item @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/, GNU Guile}, version 2.0.9 or later
@item @url{http://www.libssh.org/, libssh}, version 0.6.4 or later
@end itemize

Get the sources of Guile-SSH from GitHub:

@example
$ git clone git@@github.com:artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh.git
@end example

Configure the sources:

@example
$ cd guile-ssh/
$ autoreconf -if
$ ./configure
@end example

Build and install the library:

@example
$ make
$ make install
@end example

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
@file{INSTALL} file.

Please @strong{note} that you will need
@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/, Automake} version 1.12 or
later to run self-tests with @command{make check} (but the library
itself can be built with older Automake version such as 1.11).

@strong{important} You probably want to call @command{configure} with
the @option{--with-guilesitedir} option so that this package is
installed in Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your
Guile site directory is, run @command{configure} without the option,
and it will give you a suggestion.
