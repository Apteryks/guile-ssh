Guile-SSH News
--------------

* Unreleased

** ssh:session-set!
   Fix the bug that leads to an error if the user tried to set a
   correct boolean option.

** Fix a typo in an option symbol
   'strcthostkeycheck -> 'stricthostkeycheck


* Changes in version 0.3.1 (2013-07-14)

** Use a simpler method to GC'ing of SSH channels.
   The idea is that we don't have to free resources allocated by a
   channel during its GC'ing, because these resources will be freed
   anyway when the related SSH session is GC'ed.  However, to be able
   to control allocating of resources more precisely, introduce new
   procedure ssh:free-channel! that can be used for freeing resources
   allocated by a channel.

** ssh:free-channel!
   New procedure.

** Make the library thread-safe.


* Changes in version 0.3 (2013-07-13)

** Improve working with public keys.
   Because some libssh functions are working with public keys
   represented as a ssh_string instead of a ssh_public_key, we try to
   hide this peculiarity so all kinds of keys are look like a <key>
   class from the Scheme perspective.

** Fix segmentation faults on GC'ing of SSH objects.
   The program doesn't crashes anymore during GC'ing of SSH objecs.

** ssh:public-key-from-file
   Make it work.  Return newly created <key> instance or #f on error.

** ssh:public-key->string
   Take a key as a <key> instance.

** ssh:private-key-from-file
   Fix call to an undefined procedure.  Return #f on error.

** ssh:get-key-type
   New procedure.  The procedure returns type for a passed <key>
   instance.  Possible types are: 'dss, 'rsa, 'rsa1, 'unknown

** ssh:userauth-get-list
   New procedure.  The procedure returns a list of available
   authentication methods for a given SSH session

** ssh:channel-read
   Fix call to an undefined procedure.  Throw guile-ssh-error
   exception on error.

** ssh:close-channel!
   Fix return value: return #t if channel is closed successfully, #f
   otherwise.

** ssh:blocking-flush!
   Return 'error by default.

** ssh:session-set!
   Fix a bug with uint32 options setting.

** SSH objects now comparable.


* Changes in version 0.2 (2013-05-25)

** Release of the first stable version of Guile-SSH.
