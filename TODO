* Ideas
** Make channel buffers configurable.
** Make use of libssh callbacks to track asynchronous events on channels
** Allow to specify the load coefficient for each node
   in (ssh dist node)
** 'dist-load' procedure
   that allows to load a local Scheme program on specified host(s).
** Make Guile-SSH work with Guile 2.0.12

* Known Bugs
** Tests
   - 'client-server.scm' sometimes fails when 'make check' is called with
     number of jobs > 1 (see '-j' flag).
** distributed forms
   - 'dist-map' sometimes failes during the job migration with the
     following error:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In thread:
ERROR: Could not open forward channel #<tunnel 127.0.0.1:0 -> localhost:37147 91b72a8> error
