* Ideas
** Make channel buffers configurable.
** Make use of libssh callbacks to track asynchronous events on channels
** Allow to specify the load coefficient for each node
   in (ssh dist node)

* Known Bugs
** distributed forms
   - 'dist-map' sometimes failes during the job migration with the
     following error:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In thread:
ERROR: Could not open forward channel #<tunnel 127.0.0.1:0 -> localhost:37147 91b72a8> error
#+END_EXAMPLE
** rrepl
   - Does not handle output very well.
   - Does not handle REPL commands such as ',h'.
