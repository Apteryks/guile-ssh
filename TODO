* Ideas
** Make channel buffers configurable.
** Make use of libssh callbacks to track asynchronous events on channels

* Known Bugs
** `channel-open?', `channel-eof?' and other opeartions fail on a closed channel
   because all the resources were freed when the channel was closed.  That's
   the reason why we get "Segmentation fault" error.
