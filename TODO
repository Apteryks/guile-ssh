* Improve GC'ing of SSH channels.
  Array of channel references stored in session_data can only grow for
  now.  Generally it means two things: a) the maximum number of
  channels is limited by UINT32_MAX, and b) closed channels won't be
  removed from the array.  That is, if your program constantly opens
  new channels for one session, then at some point you can run into
  the problems with making new channels.
