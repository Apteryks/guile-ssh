* Ideas
** Make channel buffers configurable.
** Make use of libssh callbacks to track asynchronous events on channels
** DONE Use more robust approach to evaluate Lisp code on a remote side
   Quoting Ludovic Courtès, "[...] it might be best to not use the REPL at
   all.  In the Shepherd I used a simple protocol whereby the sexp to evaluate
   is passed to the other process, which returns an sexp denoting success and
   a list of return values, or failure and an exception.

   That way you don’t have to “parse” anything; you just get a clear
   description of the return values or the exception that you got."

   Food for thought.

** Allow to specify the load coefficient for each node
   in (ssh dist node)
** 'dist-load' procedure
   that allows to load a local Scheme program on specified host(s).
