Guile-SSH is a library that provides access to the SSH protocol for
programs written in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] interpreter.  It is a wrapper to the
underlying [[http://www.libssh.org/][libssh]] library.

* Requirements

 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] 1.8.x or 2.0.x
 - [[http://www.libssh.org/][libssh]] 0.5.4 or 0.5.5

* Distribution

Files:
 - AUTHORS contains list of people who contributed to the library
   development.
 - COPYING contains the terms of GNU General Public License.
 - INSTALL contains general instructions for building/installing of
   Guile-SSH.
 - NEWS describes user-visible changes.
 - TODO contains plans for the further development.

Directories:
 - examples -- Examples of Guile-SSH usage.
 - ssh      -- Sources of the Guile-SSH library.
 - doc      -- Documentation in Texinfo format.
 - tests    -- Unit tests.

Files are usually installed according to the prefix specified to
=configure= script, =/usr/local= by default.  Building and installing
gives you:

Libraries, in =${prefix}/lib=:
 - libguile-ssh.so.<version>
 - libguile-ssh.la
 - libguile-ssh.a

Guile modules, in =${GUILE_SITE}/ssh=:
 - auth.scm    -- User authentication.
 - channel.scm -- Channel manipulation.
 - key.scm     -- Keys management.
 - message.scm -- Procedures for working with SSH messages.
 - server.scm  -- Server API.
 - session.scm -- Session management.
 - version.scm -- Information about versions.

Documentation in Info format, in =${prefix}/share/info/=:
 - guile-ssh.info

Examples, in =${prefix}/share/libguile-ssh/examples=:
 - ssshd.scm    -- SSH server example.
 - sssh.scm     -- SSH client example.
 + echo/
   - client.scm -- Echo client example.
   - server.scm -- Echo server example.
* Installation

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
INSTALL file.

Please *note* that you will need Automake 1.12 or later to run
self-tests with `make check' (but the library itself can be built with
older Automake version such as 1.11).

*important* You probably want to call configure with the
`--with-guilesitedir' option so that this package is installed in
Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your Guile site
directory is, run "configure" without the option, and it will give you
a suggestion.
